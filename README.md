# Hierarchical Clustering: Linkages and Features
This task requires you to implement Hierarchical clustering, and perform clustering on a given dataset(s). The list of subtasks is given below. You are expected to implement the required, using classes and methods. We expect to see
routines like hc.linkages(X, linkage type) (takes the data and provides linkage
matrix), hc.dendogram(Z) (takes the linkage matrix and plots a dendogram).

1. Perform hierarchical clustering on the dataset and obtain the linkage matrix. Vary the linkages and features used and state your observations.
Plot the dendogram using the linkage matrix.
2. Perform hierarchical clustering on the gene expression dataset and obtain
the linkage matrix. Vary the linkages and features used and state your
observations. (In the dataset, you are given 58 genes, their respective
expression levels for 12 proteins and their IDs, resulting in a 58 Ã— 13
matrix). Plot the dendogram, using the linkages obtained.
